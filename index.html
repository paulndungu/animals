        <p>An animal is a living organism that feeds on organic matter, typically having specialized sense organs and nervous system and able to respond rapidly to stimuli(something that invokes a specific function reaction in an object).</p>
        <p>The number of animal species ranges from 7 million and increasing.</p>

        <p>Animals have certain characteristics that set them apart from other living organisms.</p>
        <p>This characteristics are:
            <dd>a)They are multicellular.</dd>

                    <h3>Structure of animals.</h3>
                        <p>Animals are made up of cells surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix(3d network of extracellular macromolecules). During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible. Animal bodies are differentied into tissues with exceptions of some such as sponges and placozoans(basal form of non-parasitic multicellular organism).</p>

                    <h3>Reproduction of animals.</h3>
                        <p>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction. They produce haploid(number of sets of chromosomes normally found in a gamete) gametes(haploid cell that fuses with another haploid cell during fertilization in organisms that sexually reproduce.) by meiosis(type of cell division that reduces chromosome by a half). These fuse to form zygotes, which develop via mitosis(part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei)  into a hollow sphere, called a blastula.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Animals are categorised into ecological groups depending on how they obtain or consume organic material. The most common types of classification that you may know without even having to be in a biology class would be carnivores(e.g: lion), herbivores(e.g: zebra) and omnivores(e.g: pigs). There are other classes such as detritivores(obtains nutrients by eating detritus) and parasites. Most animals rely on the energy produced by plants through photosynthesis. Herbivores eat plant material directly, while carnivores, and other animals acquire energy(in the form of reduced carbon) by eating other animals.</p>

                <p>The <button type "button" class="btn-btn-dark">blue whale</button> is currently the largest animal to ever grace the earth. It is said to be also the largest animal that has ever lived. It weighs 190 metric tonnes and could be as long as 33.6 metres (110 ft).</p>
                <p>The largest existing terrestrial animal is the <button type "button" class="btn-btn-dark">African bush elephant</button> which weighs 12.25 tonnes and lengthwise is up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long.</p>
                <p>The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as <button type "button" class="btn-btn-dark">Argentinosaurus</button>, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the smallest we have microscopic animals which are called Myxozoa(class of aquatic, obligately parasitic cnidarian animals).</p>
