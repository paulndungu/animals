             </div>
            <p>African bush elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals on earth. It is the largest of the three elephant species and can weigh up to 11 tons and live up to 70 years—longer than any other mammal except humans. African bush elephants are herbivores and need to eat about 350 pounds of vegetation daily.</p>
             <p>Bulls(males) can reach a shoulder height of up to 3.96 m (13.0 ft) and up to 24 feet in length. Both sexes have tusks, which erupt when they are 1–3 years old and grow throughout life.</p>

            <h3>Size.</h3>
             </div>
               <p>The African bush elephant is the largest and heaviest land animal on Earth. It weighs around 10.4 tonnes. On average, males are about 3.2 metres (10.5 ft) tall at the shoulder and 6 tonnes (6.6 short tons) in weight, while females are much smaller at about 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) tall at the shoulder and 3 tonnes (3.3 short tons) in weight.</p>

            <h3>Trunks.</h3>
             </div>
               <p>The trunk is a strong appendage, with more than 40,000 muscles and tendons. Its sensitive tip ends in two finger-like projections, which can manipulate small objects. The trunk can lift objects of more than 400 pounds. Water is sucked up through the trunk and then blown into the mouth for a drink or onto the back as a cooling mist. The trunk is so strong that elephants can use it for lifting about 3% of their own body weight. They use it for smelling, touching, feeding, drinking, dusting, producing sounds, loading, defending and attacking.</p>

            <h3>Tusks and molars.</h3>
             </div>
               <p>Tusks, which are large modified incisors that grow throughout an elephant's lifetime, occur in both males and females and are used in fights and for marking, feeding, and digging. The tusks erupt when elephants are 1–3 years old and grow throughout life. They are composed of dentin and coated with a thin layer of cementum. Tusks of bulls grow faster than tusks of females. Mean weight of tusks at the age of 60 years is 109 kg (240 lb) in bulls, and 17.7 kg (39 lb) in cows. The dental formula of the African bush elephant develops six molars in each jaw quadrant that erupt at different ages and differ in size.</p>

                 </div>
             <p>The core of elephant society is the family unit, which comprises several adult cows, their daughters of all ages and their sons of prepubertal(following early childhood and preceding adolescence) age. The family unit is led by a matriarch.</p>

             <p>The African bush elephant is herbivorous. Its diet consists mainly of grasses, creepers and herbs, and in the dry season also of leaves and bark. To supplement their diet with minerals, they congregate at mineral-rich water-holes, termite mounds and mineral licks.</p>

             <p>Spermatogenesis starts when bulls are about 15 years old. Females ovulate for the first time at the age of 11 years. African bush elephants mate during the rainy season. Gestation lasts 22 months. Intervals between birth has different estimate across different parks ranging from 2.9-5yrs on average.</p>

             <p>Despite a ban on the international trade in ivory, African elephants are still being poached in large numbers. Their ivory tusks are the most sought after, but their meat and skin are also traded. The ivory is often carved into ornaments and jewellery – China is the biggest consumer market for such products.</p>
